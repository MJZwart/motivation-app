# About Motivation

Gamified to-do lists. Basically.

## (Pre-)Installations

Programs needed to work this:
- NPM: (https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
- PHP and MySQL (like through XAMPP: https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html)
- Composer: (https://getcomposer.org/download/)
- An IDE. I use Visual Studio Code at the moment, but to each their own.

## Installation

- Clone the repository off of Github (through whatever works for you)
- Go to CMD.exe or use the XAMPP shell. Make sure PHP/Apache is running
- Go to your MySQL admin and create a new database called ‘`motivation`’.
- CD to the folder you cloned the repository in and type the following:

`composer install`

`npm install`

`npm run dev`

- Make a copy of `env.example` and rename this to `.env`

`php artisan migrate:fresh --seed`

`php artisan key:generate`


## To run

In the same shell, type:

`npm run hot`

Open another shell, cd to the folder you cloned the repository in and type:

`php artisan serve`

Make sure both PHP and MySQL are running through XAMPP or the like
