#### Features

-   Finally got websockets working in production. When receiving a message or notification, the user now instantly gets a red dot on their respective icons to signal an unread message, without having to first load a new page. Reading this message or notification should get rid of the dot.
-   When picking a name for your village, character or username, you can now click the dice icon to roll a random name. These names come from the same pool as names generated for guest accounts.
-   Guest accounts can now be transformed into a regular account through the settings.
-   In the admin overview guest accounts are now shown as a separate stat.

#### Bugs

-   Fixed a bug causing messages to not show up for some reason (should only affect development environment)

#### Code

#### Known bugs

-   When receiving a message (and possibly notification), the red dot signalling an unread message may not disappear when reading the message. Reloading the page fixes this. Will be fixed in a future patch.
