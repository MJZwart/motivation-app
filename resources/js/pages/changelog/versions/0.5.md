#### Features
-  A brand new timeline to your overview page. This is also available on public profiles, if you choose to set it to visible.

#### Design
-  Changed the look of the checkboxes
-  Changed the look of this changelog. Older versions now automatically collapse and you can see changes per version.
-  Switched over to a different icon package. Some icons have been changed.


#### Bugs
-  Fixed some small database problems (that should never be an issue in production).
-  Fixed a problem where some columns weren't sortable due to them being objects, rather than numbers or strings.
